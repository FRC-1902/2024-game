# FRC Team 1902 - Exploding Bacon - 2024 CRESCENDO

Welcome to the Github repository for the 2024 code of FRC Team 1902 - Exploding Bacon! This repository contains the codebase that we used for our robot during the 2024 FIRST Robotics Competition season.

### About the Team

FRC Team 1902, Exploding Bacon, is a high school robotics team based in Orlando, Florida. We are a community-driven team that focuses on STEM education and outreach. Our team is dedicated to creating a positive impact in our community through the power of robotics. We run a variety of programs, outreaches, and more, so feel free to visit us on our website: [explodingbacon.com](https://explodingbacon.com/)

### About the Code

The code for our robot is written in Java, using the following external libraries: [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/), [REVLib](https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/package-summary.html), [PathPlanner](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner), [PhotonVision](https://github.com/PhotonVision/photonvision), and [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit). Additionally, we are using [Elastic Dashboard](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard) instead of a built-in dashboard such as Shuffleboard or Smart Dashboard, it is directly compatible with those two APIs. The code is organized into several different packages, each with a specific purpose. The robot's code is organized in the standard command-based layout.

### Getting Started

If you'd like to get started with our codebase, there are a few things you'll need to do:

    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    - Open the codebase in your preferred Java IDE.
    - Install the WPILib and REVlib.
    - Deploy the code to your robot and start testing!
